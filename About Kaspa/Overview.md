# Overview

Kaspa is an instant confirmation transaction sequencing layer. Transactions sent to miners can be included immediately in the ledger, which is structured as a blockDAG, to support asynchronous state updates.
Kaspa is based on the PHANTOM protocol, a scalable generalization of Nakamoto Consensus. Its design is faithful to the principles Satoshi embedded into Bitcoin -- proof-of-work mining, UTXO-formed isolated state, deflationary monetary policy, no premine, no central governance.
Kaspa is unique in its ability to support high block rates while maintaining the level of security offered by proof-of-work environments. Kaspa’s current testnet operates with 1 block per second. Down the road, core developers and researchers will work on stretching the capability to the limits—think 10 or even 100 blocks per second (enabling a miner of 1% of the hashrate to mine on average 1 block every second!).
