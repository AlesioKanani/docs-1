# Open Projects

The following is a running list of projects important to Kaspa. These would benefit from leadership and/or contributions from the community.

1. Rollup support.
2. Implementing a client in Rust to improve performance of Kaspad and potentially increase block rate validation capability by 10x.
3. Research on MEV and flashbots resistance as it relates to blockDAGs.
4. Support for Lightning Network; op_codes that make Lightning compatibility easier. 
5. Implementing an (interactive) batch of Shnorr signatures.
6. Integration of off-chain privacy mixing hubs (e.g., ValueShuffle).

Discussions of these projects and suggestions for other Kaspa-related projects can take place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RBXH7gkZnz).
